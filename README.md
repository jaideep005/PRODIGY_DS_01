Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

Visualization: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
